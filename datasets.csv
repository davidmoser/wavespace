Year,Name,Type,Size / key stats & sample kinds,Room / background control,Match to your needs*
2020,FUSS (Free Universal Sound Separation),dataset + Python recipe,"23 h single-source clips from 357 classes; official script creates 10 s mixtures with 1–4 events, simulated RIRs, optional anechoic (“anechoic” flag)",Script lets you remove the always-on “background” source or change RIR set,"✔ full pipeline; ✖ musical coverage is sparse and unlabeled in detail (zenodo.org, arxiv.org)"
2017,NSynth,dataset,"≈ 306 k four-second notes, 1000+ instruments, pitched & percussive, 16 kHz",no built-in acoustics; convolve with external RIRs,"✔ isolated hits across pitch; needs external room sim (magenta.tensorflow.org, paperswithcode.com)"
2020,TinySOL,dataset,2 913 high-quality (44.1 kHz/24-bit) notes from 14 orchestral instruments,dry studio; no room or background,"✔ clean pitched notes; limited size, no percussion (zenodo.org)"
1997–2024,U of Iowa MIS,dataset,"30 orchestral instruments, all pitches & dynamics, recorded in anechoic chamber; thousands of WAV files",perfectly dry,✔ large clean pitched set; ✖ no percussion (theremin.music.uiowa.edu)
2014,IDMT-SMT Drums,dataset,"608 isolated hits (kick, snare, hi-hat) across 4 kits",dry,✔ clean percussion; small palette (3 drum types) (idmt.fraunhofer.de)
2023,StemGMD,dataset,1 224 h isolated stems for every element of a 9-piece drum kit (synthesised from MIDI),dry; stems can be trimmed to single hits,"✔ huge percussion variety; ✖ not single hits by default, file sizes large (arxiv.org)"
2017,Scaper,library,Python toolkit to place any number of events (< 10 s) on a timeline; exports mixture & event metadata,works on raw waveforms; user can omit background; no room model,✔ fast mixture generation; convolve output with RIRs for room effect (github.com)
2024,SpatialScaper,library,"Adds 3-D room model (size, wall absorption, moving sources) to Scaper; auto-convolution with simulated RIRs",background optional; full room param control,✔ drop-in advanced room sim without real RIR collection (arxiv.org)
2017,Pyroomacoustics,library,"Image-source and hybrid ray/RD tracing RIR generator; supports arbitrary source counts, microphone arrays",complete control over room geometry & materials; no notion of background vs foreground,✔ physics-based RIRs; integrate with any dataset (arxiv.org)
2022,SoundSpaces 2.0,simulator,Real-time geometry-based renderer for large 3-D scans; emits view- and pose-dependent binaural audio,highly realistic rooms; steeper learning curve,✔ highest fidelity; ✖ heavyweight for quick 10 s mixtures (arxiv.org)
